    <p>
    This week was really interesting, but also scary how you can easily modify and generate pictures. The technic is already so far. For me this week open up the possibilities to design different kind of image date. Its possible to show the evolution of a city or the climate change. Also you can show all images for example of animals which look very similar to each other and make a overflow to show the similarity. Also you can change a 2D painting into a 3D video, while connecting it with your movements. In the end I would have liked to learn a bid about VR/AR to understand more and be able to create new ideas with it.

    xarxa night
    </h3>
    <p>
    It was the second time of the event called “Xarxa Night”. Roberto organises this event in our MDEF classroom at IAAC in Poblenau to give everyone a chance to present something that you like or that you are interested in and want to share it with others. Last time Roberto told us about mushrooms and this time Busi talked about female dj´s and Didac about his favourite area in Spain called Catalynia.

    mashine learning
    </h3>
    <p>
    The week we explore the world of machine learning. We made different exercises, like modifying our pictures. We could use machine/tools, which think, create and see on their own. It starts with chess computers. Machine learning means: automatic tasks by providing examples (training data) instead of writing instructions (code), for example for recognising products in pictures, what you can see on  right. They learn It from examples and not from instructions. Also you can use deep-learning, this works with neural networks , where the different types depends on: internal functioning, what kind of data, what tasks you want tot automate and specific models. Also you have different typologies of deep learning like: Image classification, emotion detection, object/voice recognition, image/natural language processing, image/text/ voice generation and time series prediction. Every deep learning and machine learning algorithms are part of artificial intelligence. For a good evaluation you need a large amount of data and homogeneity and heterogeneity dataset. You can have bias in your datasets like: sample, exclusion, measurement, recall, observer, racial or association bias.     <a href="https://tallerestampa.com/" style="text-decoration:none;">--> Estampa Website</a>

    <p>
    The first task was to run a neural network, while uploading an image with different kind of items and process them with the detect.py script that comes with the network. The results you can see in the two right pictures, where the items have been recognized like: persons, vases, laptops, sink and books. For the second task we first checked the computer capacity. Then we install all the required libraries and uploaded a picture of ourselves, what you can see on the right. Then we try to find ourselves in the latent space, which generates the image that I more similar to the portrait in 1000 steps. It was really interesting to see how close the generated image looked like compared to the uploaded one. The next step was to modify ourselves inside the latent space, change factors, like female/male, smiling or looking serious. The third task we sended our last 100 pictures from our phones to the teachers, so in total we had around 3000 pictures. The programm could recognise the pictures and could coordinate similar pictures together, like pictures related to food or forests and so on.    <a href="https://tallerestampa.com/treballs/MDEF/phone.html#" style="text-decoration:none;">--> 3000 images data</a>

    design intervention
    </h3>
    <img class="left" src="gruppe.jpeg" alt="Naturbild" width="35%" height="auto"/>
    <p>
    Together with my classmates: Paula B, Paula, Virkant und Ruben, we held a workshop on the 6th december called "Conversaciones Marduras". We decided to focuse on the huge amount of food waste we get in our food system. We want to adress to the people and raise awarness with cooking and other activities with food waste. Everything to educate people and show options to use it, like showing people what to do with the rest of cooking waste. First we checked where we can get food. It was not easy because many supermarkets have already companies who get the food trash, which is good! In the end we found one where we got different fruits and vegetables. The most amount were tomatoes and apples. Then we decide what we want to do the intervention, which we could do at the MDEF alumni’s studio in hospital. We thought about following activities: conversations and thoughts about ingredients: everyone, coming up with recipes: everyone, cooking: Vikrant and Paula, seed origin on the world map: Ruben, peeling veggies or fruit for artwork: Gerda, recording/taking pics: Pau und Gerda, natural dying: Pau, showing and producing organic fertilizer: Gerda, explaining how to make a compost: Gerda. Then we organised the tables: where are we going to do which workshop, invite different kind of people who are related to food and others, who are not part of the MDEF group. And we designed a recipe book with recipes from food waste, like carrot greens pesto, knodel out of hard bread, radish leaf soup, apple peel chips, papaya seeds as pepper and beetroot leaf salat.
    </p>
    <p>
    The workshops bring interesting results. Everybody seemed interested and wanted to try all different kind of workshop activities. They didn’t knew the possibilities to use food waste for the fertilizer which we showed: organic fertilizer: banana peels in water for 24 hours and then use the water without the peels and mix it with water and add it to your plants, coffee grounds just let them dry for a few days or dry them in the oven and mix them with the soil and the small parts of the egg shells you can put over your soil. Also for them it was nice to see how the compost layers are combined: wet paper, leaves, soil, earthworms and foodwaste (can not be cooked or oranges/lemons). The origin map activity showed us how uneducated people are also like us about food origins. Now we can buy at each time all different kind of fruits and vegetables and in every country, which was not and should be not normal. The supply-chains are long and not sustainable. Growing food in all seasons is not easy and you need many pesticides and artificial sun. The result of the origins of the food is this: Peppers: Region of Panama, Tomato: Region of Brasil, Potatoes: Region of Argentina, Strawberries: Region of Argentina, Cambodsha: orange, Bananas: Myanmar, Eggplant: India, Cucumber: India, Onions: Afghanistan, Apple: Region north Pakistan, Lemon: Region Tibet, Cantaloupe: Region Tibet, Mango: Region Brahmaputra, Watermelon: Libya, Clementine: Algeria, Carrot: Belgium, Courgette: Italy, Olives: Greece.

    What are you taking out of this intervention? This intervention really showed us and the people more possibilities to take advantage with all the food and reduce food waste, to have in the end less waste. n this design intervention my role was to bring hopefully new ideas to the people, what to do with food waste what is not food. Show them there are more options to use it for good impacts, you reuse the waste and help for example your plants to be even more healthy and grow faster then before. I would love to focus more on food and agriculture waste. In total, about 13 tonnes of food waste are produced in Germany in a year. And depending on the country even more or less. And still there is hunger all over the world, by the end of 2020, up to 811 million people would be suffering from chronic hunger. This does not make sense. I would love to go more deep into this topic. Also in the agriculture is a big amount of waste which the farmer burn, because of not knowing how to use everything. In the next steps I would like to go deeper in the topic, how is It possible to change the supply chain, so the food is better distributed and less wasted. Also to think about what else you could do with food scraps, if you haven´t plants for example.
    </p>
    <p>
    We made a survey in the end to ask the people what they learned/ where interessed the most and so on. What interested you about the workshop? To get to know more about how to treat well our environment using the products we have within reach, Creative ways to reuse wasted food, Experimenting with very simple ingredients to create a whole meal, Have new ideas for new veggie food, the opportunity to cook and be creative for a good purpose. After this workshop, what would you do differently in your daily life? Specially how to give a second chance to the food that looks not useful anymore, but it isn't, Find ways to reuse my personal food scraps for soil fertilizer or mini-compost. Circularity in my own home., Refrain from buying daily and trying to make the most of what we have. Also buying locally, Take advantage with all the food and reduce food waste, I would go out of my comfort zone to cook something unexpected from ingredients I would normally consider almost "bad". Is there something you would like to explore deeper from what we saw on the workshop? It was really interesting to know about the country origin of some fruit and vegetable, and it would be awsome to know about the the import of the products to the differents countries from a historical point of view, I’d like to learn more about where our produce originated from and how it migrated and settled in to different cultures. As this was the part of the workshop I had NO idea about., Apart from food, what else can be made from waste food, More receipts with leftover, composting.

    medical device
    </h3>
    <p>
    This task was about creating a robot or a technical device which analyses and creates data. We thought about persons who are struggling to know what problems/issues they have and who are feeling stressed because of it. It includes personal and physical issues. So we thought about a device which tracks physical (Frequency of voice, Eyes strain, Heartbeat, Body temperature, Blood oxygen, Hydratation, Digestion, Alternative data we could use as an input: Brain activity), social (Social media activity, Time spent with people, News / Potential stress factors, Music listened to (Spotify)) and environmental (Outside / Inside, Temperature, Air quality, Noise Frequency, Level of light and Kelvin temperature) input. We thought about a set of devices for different parts of the body to get the good quantity and quality of data. So put your devices on the phone to get the different auras, which includes forms, colours and maybe noises. The Name is after the psychologist Sigmund Freud: Freud and the E , so freude means happiness and that’s our wellbeing analyst, which helps you to understand reasons of your current state and show you opportunities for feeling better.
    </p>
    <p>
    About ethics you can say, you have positive and negative. Negative impacts could be: Creating anxiety, Too much focus on tech, Even more screen time, Trust less your personal feeling, Many wearable devices, Invading personal space and Errors in interpretation could have an impact on your health. Positive impacts could be Makes you calm when you feel stressed about your health, Calming colors, Calming data visualization based on color gradients, Suggests opportunities to feel better and gives you autonomy in understanding your health state (possibility to dive deeper in the data if you want to).
    </p>
    <p>
    The confusion matrix is devided by four sections: true positive, false negative, false positive and true negative. True positive could be: Tracking moods according to the real person state. People feel understood. The machine says you are feeling well and this is true! False negative could be: People feel confused about their emotional state. The machine says you are feeling bad while you are in perfect health. False positive: People feel confused about their emotional state. Stress and lonely feelings. The machine says you are feeling well but you are in the worst moment of your life. True negative: Tracking moods according to the real person state. People feel understood. Giving correct opportunities to feel better. The machine says you are not feeling well and this is true.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outputs for this device could be the influences and levels of reaching a mental and physical state, insights on changing habits before a problem could happen, notifications on a problem or change in your body need to be addressed, the data that was sourced to make you aware of a problem and abstract representation of data helps with data anxiety.

    dataset with artisticmovements
    </h3>
    <p>
    This week we should think about a concept to create a dataset. We had different kind of ideas like: “Understanding the connection between our different spotify “auras” and creating a collective aura of our group”, “Having the AI output a “club” experience based on images and sound from a club: what an AI thinks a party looks/sounds like”, “Connecting different historical events in a network instead of just seeing them in a timeline thanks to the state of art of our education systems (ex.: Anne Frank-Martin Luther King) (machine learning) Pantheon” and “Having a climate impact experience: seeing the old world, the actual world and how the world could look like when we are not stopping the climate change (examples as it has been done, like this climat not does exist)”. In the end we focused on: Associating artistic movements with music at the time - then Machine Learning outputs new prediction for future. The project has a creative approach that is speculative of the future. The dataset would consist of various artistic movements and the music contemporary to that period in time. With the goal to observe and understand how popular music and art styles have evolved together throughout time, and predict what that might look like in the future. We would need to create a new dataset because there is no one similar existing. So we gather pictures of specific art movements throughout time and the musical movements which accompanied them. Datasets could be sourced from worldwide museum art existing libraries and archives of historical art pieces. We were talking about the different art-epoches: Ancient Art, Renaissance, Gothic, Baroque, rococo, Classism, Romanticism, Monumentalism , impressionism, Art nouveau, Art deco, Realism, Modernism, Symbolism, Cubism, surrealism, dada and pop art.
