    overview
    </h3>
    <p>
    We want to explore ways in which we can live a more resilient lifestyle and try to implement systems that are less dependent on fossil fuel energy. By approaching this subject we started experimenting with a Solar Oven to see if you could use the energy of the Sun to heat up our food instead of the usual microwave or oven. With this we try to start a slow movement in which we bring awareness to our everyday habits and embrace a slower pace with processes. This will pave the way to enjoy more the moment and eliminate the rush of our daily activities by giving time for things to transform.

    our feedback
    </h3>
    <p>
    <mark>considerations</mark> We could have focused just on the solar oven with the thermometer instead of building the music box, but we wanted to have everything ready for our solar brunch event, which was two days later.
    <p>
    <mark>future steps</mark> Now we wanted to finish the thermometer box and attach it to the oven. Also we want to build two other solar oven designs.
