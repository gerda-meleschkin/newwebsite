    <p>
    <mark>learning outcome</mark> The first class after the easter holidays we continue electronics and after the the class outputs we learned things about different kind of inputs. For example there are different kind of sensors, like synthetic sensors, which are highly capable that can indirectly monitor a large context, without direct instrumentation of objects. Also there are other ones like static and moveable sensors, which can measure different things like : light, movement, touch (pressure) and so on. Sensors are often for capturing information and getting data. They are also different ways of working, some are “simple” they work with: yes or no / high or low / 1 or 0 / true or false, where you just have two situations.

    <mark>reflection</mark> The next time I am focusing on electronics, I want to understand more and practise and experiment.

    <h3>
    week 14: networking & communications
    </h3>

    <p>
    <mark>learning outcome</mark> This week we went through the topic networking, which basically means copying information in two places. We use networks and communication protocols to distribute and connect systems due to: location (not everything is everywhere possible), parallelism (processes which work at the same time), modularity (how good it is scalable and exchangeable) and interference (which should not be there). The more information you send and the faster, the easier you get errors. But also there are different types: transmission media (cable, optic, radio frequency), topology and the range.

    The networking could work wired or wireless. Wired you have different types as well. Serial and parallel. Parallel interfaces transfer multiple bits at the same time. They usually require buses of data - transmitting across eight, sixteen, or more wires. Can be with high speeds, but with a lot of wires. Serial interfaces stream their data with a reference signal, one single bit at a time These interfaces one wire, usually never more than four. Then you can make a difference in synchronous and asynchronous. Asynchronous works without an external clock, synchronous without. Asynchronous communication include: RX/TX and UART. Synchronous include I2C and SPI. The wireless version works with antennas like: monopole, dipole, helical, half Wave dipole or patch antenna´s. There is also a range-Power-Dbi Gain, where dB means decibels, we use this unit to measure the level of sound, but in radio we also use dB to measure signal strength.

    <mark>reflection</mark> I just made a plan because i realised the master is almost over and also we need to finish all the deliveries.
