    <mark>learning outcome</mark> This week we got a big amount of input about possible parts of the PCB board. There are different things like the SMD resistors, which could have different colours which includes different amounts of energy. There are also capacitors, which are like small fast charging batteries. It’s a passive electrical component with the ability to store electric charge and the associated energy statically in an electric field in a DC circuit. It could be out of ceramic (non polarized, equally charged) or electrolytic (polarized, positive and negative charged). If you have a power supply with to much energy for your sensors, capacitors could help to put the amount down. Then you can have diodes/ led lights, which also help the electricity to go just in one direction. Zener/Schottky diodes are the types of diodes which let a bid energy through. Oscillator normally have a oval or cylindric shape, it’s like a metrum, which observes the vibrations or like a weight or clock. Mosfet or transittors are the muscles of any board, they are very similar. But transistors are used for very high accurat applications. For example you have a micro controller with 5v dc and a decive with light with 1000 v dc and then the mosfets to control everything. Regulators (reg) are regulating the power supply, so which amount of energy should go through, it includes Volt and Ampere. For designing the PCB boards which could include these different parts you can use different EDA softwares (electronic design automation) like: “Kicad”, “Autodesk eagle”, “fritzing” or “Gitlab”.

    <mark>reflection</mark> In this week the most of the things were new for me and very interesting, but also hard to understand. In the precourse and also during the first term we had some classes about electronics but not specifically designing a pcb board. Also the programs were completely new for me and I was excited to learn them.
    </p>
    <p>
    <mark>tasks</mark> Before starting to design the pcb boards, I downloaded two libraries to upload them in the program: In the fab library the fab.lib file and in the foodprints the fab.pretty file. Then I conceptualize the board with knowing what I want to do and which components I need. After that I started to design  the board in the “Eeschema”- part. After adding the parts I generated the netlist and opened this one in the programm to finalize the board. And then I start fabricating.
    </p>
    <p>
    I designed a board for planting vegetables. So I thought about which sesonrs /parts do I need. I wanted to have a humidity, temperature and light sensor to get stabile conditions and save water and prevent pesticides. Also I wanted to have some buttons, to see if the board is one or not and if its uploading when I plug it into my computer.

    <h3>
    week 7: computer controlled mashinig
    </h3>
    <p>
    <mark>learning outcome</mark>This week we learned everything about CNC (Computerized Numerical Control). CNC is a very accurate, flexible and automate way of digital fabrication and can be used for various designs. There are two types of CNC with 3 axes or then one with more then 3 (multiple). This machines often have a huge weight and content liquid for cooling down. There are two different motors for the machines router (cheaper) and spindle (more quiet, more horse power). For milling you need liquid so the material will not break, which called lubbing. It can be automatically (powerful, expensive, dirty) or manually (cheap, clean, weak). You need to take care about different things while milling, also like the kerf tolerance and also the material is “bouncing” back. Also you cannot have a sharp edge at the end, it will be always round, or you need to make a t- or dog bone (like on the picture). The t-bone you could see from the sight, but the dog bone gives less support in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the fabrication you need to create a 3-modell and then export it to a g-code and change the specific material and machine settings. You can have two different bits: mills (for milling = flat) go sideways when turning or drills (for holes = round) go down when turning. And also different kind of rotations: straight (Easy for plastics), Up (Metalls dence materials), Down (For soft materials) and Compression (For laminating materials). The next is to set up the cnc chip load, which is the amount of material being removed by each glute of the cutting tooll per revolution. You can mill from the top (climbing) or from the sight. To have it more accurate you need attachments, which could be through a vacuum, T-slot, Double side tape, Screws or taps.

    <p>
    <mark>reflection</mark> I figured out that the cnc is nice but I think for some parts its easier just to use conventional saws etc., because all the settings take a lot of time. Also I focused more on grasshopper again and designed parts with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    <mark>tasks</mark>For our slow lab this week I wanted to do a food storage with the cnc and als i wanted to try building a stool. Also I set myself a task to use grasshopper and create another model with layers and “nesting” and learn how to do it. First I designed the 3d file with RHINO and then I added the t-bones for the joints, to get a better shape to join the parts, because when milling with a normal bit you get a round corner instead of a 90% angle. The t- or dog-bone helps you to make useable joints. After that I saved the file into a dxf one and import it in the programm “EAGLE”. Then I checked the settings for the bit I want to use and set the up in the programm and also the specific one for the machine, like the speed and so one. To callibrate the CNC mashine, first screw, glue or otherwise secure the wooden plate to the mounting plate. Next, the bit is fixed by screwing it with the entire head to the mashine. Then the x and y axis are specified/fixed manually and a distance meter is used for the z axis. Then the ventilation is switched on. Next, the NC file is uploaded to the Kenetic program and the spindle and feet are reseted. And then the settings are defined.

    week 8: embedded programming
    </h3>
    <p>
    <mark>learning outcome</mark>
    </p>
    <p>
    <mark>reflection</mark> This week I recognize that I really need to focus on learning more about electronics. I do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable about the specific parts to be able to programm something on my own, but would love to learn it. In the future I can imagine that programming will be useful more and more and its good to know at least the basics to understand the workflow.
