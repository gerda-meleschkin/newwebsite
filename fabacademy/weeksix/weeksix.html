    <mark>learning outcome</mark> This week we got a big amount of input about possible parts of the PCB board. There are different things like the SMD resistors, which could have different colours which includes different amounts of energy. There are also capacitors, which are like small fast charging batteries. It’s a passive electrical component with the ability to store electric charge and the associated energy statically in an electric field in a DC circuit. It could be out of ceramic (non polarized, equally charged) or electrolytic (polarized, positive and negative charged). If you have a power supply with to much energy for your sensors, capacitors could help to put the amount down. Then you can have diodes/ led lights, which also help the electricity to go just in one direction. Zener/Schottky diodes are the types of diodes which let a bid energy through. Oscillator normally have a oval or cylindric shape, it’s like a metrum, which observes the vibrations or like a weight or clock. Mosfet or transittors are the muscles of any board, they are very similar. But transistors are used for very high accurat applications. For example you have a micro controller with 5v dc and a decive with light with 1000 v dc and then the mosfets to control everything. Regulators (reg) are regulating the power supply, so which amount of energy should go through, it includes Volt and Ampere. For designing the PCB boards which could include these different parts you can use different EDA softwares (electronic design automation) like: “Kicad”, “Autodesk eagle”, “fritzing” or “Gitlab”.

    <mark>reflection</mark> In this week the most of the things were new for me and very interesting, but also hard to understand. In the precourse and also during the first term we had some classes about electronics but not specifically designing a pcb board. Also the programs were completely new for me and I was excited to learn them.
    </p>
    <p>
    <mark>tasks</mark> Before starting to design the pcb boards, I downloaded two libraries to upload them in the program: In the fab library the fab.lib file and in the foodprints the fab.pretty file. Then I conceptualize the board with knowing what I want to do and which components I need. After that I started to design  the board in the “Eeschema”- part. After adding the parts I generated the netlist and opened this one in the programm to finalize the board. And then I start fabricating.
    </p>

    I designed a board for planting vegetables. So I thought about which sesonrs /parts do I need. I wanted to have a humidity, temperature and light sensor to get stabile conditions and save water and prevent pesticides. Also I wanted to have some buttons, to see if the board is one or not and if its uploading when I plug it into my computer.
