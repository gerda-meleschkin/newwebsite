    <p>
    I would like to reflect on the class before the Mallorca field trip (8.3.2022). Mariana gives us some tips and let Audrey and me think about the slow lab, with whom we want to work with, what we want to reach, what is special and to bring solar punc to the city. I mean we still need to understand that we are living in the city, so how can we connect nature and city again? And bring people to make things slow, when they have a busy daily life. Also we need to make it more opensource and write every step down. On the 19.4.2022 we thought about our main learnings from Mallorca and for me it was: going forward and not being afraid of asking people, start doing/ contacting, at the beginning of the master everything was more a mess and in the second term I could connect the points more and also I learned the whole life is a process which you never finish. The first term I start finding my self-topic and interests, second term I was experimenting a lot and in the third term I what to focus and create specific solutions and share it with everyone.

    <p>
    <mark>fermented onion</mark> For the fermented onions I got two big red onions, pepper corns, 2 table spoon salt and 400 ml of water. First, cut the onions into thin strips. Then, in a bowl, stir the salt into the water until it dissolves. Next, add the bay leaves and peppercorns to the bail jar and place the sliced onions on top. Last, pour everything with the salt water and screw the fermenting top on top. Leave the jar darkened at room temperature for about 2 weeks. After this time you can enjoy the onions very well for grilling.

    <p>
    <mark>dried apple, banana & tomato</mark> I cut thin slides of apple’s, banana and tomato’s then I put it all slides separately on a shelf with a net. I let them dry for two days. Due to the recirculation, the heated air flows around the food. This allows moisture and liquids to evaporate and escape. This simple principle of preservation has been used in food production for decades.

    <mark>pickled cuecumber</mark> For the pickled cucumbers I got 1kg of cucumbers, 400ml light vinegar, 600ml water, 200g sugar, 1.5 tablespoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, 0.5 onions and 4 bay leaves. First, cut the onions into thin strips. Thoroughly brush and wash the cucumbers and soak them overnight in salted water (rising bubbles are normal here). The next day, lightly mortar the juniper berries, allspice, pepper and mustard seeds so that the skins crack. Bring vinegar, sugar, salt and water to a boil, boiling the cucumbers in portions for two minutes each. Cut onions into rings and layer between the cucumbers in the thoroughly cleaned jars. Add 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoon crushed spices and ¼ teaspoon dill to each jar. Divide the boiling broth among the jars, then immediately close the lids. Turn the jars upside down and leave to infuse in a dark place for two to three weeks.

    solar brunch
    </h3>
    <p>
    We made an event to get people in touch with different low tech devices and talk about ideas and thoughts how to bring old techniques to out daily life and combine them with new ones. Also to make them more attractive and promote a resilient lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
    After almost all participants have arrived we have first of all made an introduction, introduced ourselves, who we are and what we are doing and everyone explained what they are doing and interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
    During the event we were showing and explaining different kind of low tech devices: Solar panels for soldering, charging your phone and powering the music boxes, then a fireless cooker as a stool, an evaporative cooler as a clay pot with sand and water and three different models of solar ovens. Also we were connecting with people, exchanging ideas and thoughts and talked about possible collaborations. And of course we were eating out prepared cold food including salads, preservation techniques, bread and snacks and the warm food out of the solar ovens including different vegetables and chocolate as a desert.
    </p>
    <p>
    In total we were 36 participants including eight our friends, kris and his colleague from “Low tech magazine” and us “Slow lab”, which include Paula Bustos, Audrey and me. We got also nice feedback with considerations and reflections from the people, who were participating:
