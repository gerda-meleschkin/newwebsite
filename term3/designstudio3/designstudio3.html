    <p>
    I would like to reflect on the class before the Mallorca field trip (8.3.2022). Mariana gives us some tips and let Audrey and me think about the slow lab, with whom we want to work with, what we want to reach, what is special and to bring solar punc to the city. I mean we still need to understand that we are living in the city, so how can we connect nature and city again? And bring people to make things slow, when they have a busy daily life. Also we need to make it more opensource and write every step down. On the 19.4.2022 we thought about our main learnings from Mallorca and for me it was: going forward and not being afraid of asking people, start doing/ contacting, at the beginning of the master everything was more a mess and in the second term I could connect the points more and also I learned the whole life is a process which you never finish. The first term I start finding my self-topic and interests, second term I was experimenting a lot and in the third term I what to focus and create specific solutions and share it with everyone.
