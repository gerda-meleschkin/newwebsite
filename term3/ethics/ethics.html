    technological determinism

    <p>
    Technology is a part of our existence, it is not neutral, not does it determine us. We cannot be human without technology anymore, its almost impossible to avoid, like we are living in the Technosphere. Also during designing things we use technology in different ways, for example we use trees to protect the streets or design for example toothbrushes because in our society we said teeth hygiene is important. Technologies not has to be high tech, also other artifacts and processes are included in technology. Neutrality (To have no impact in the world) is in the middle of soft determinism (using technologies, but know they are affecting) and hard determinism (make us be how we are). Determinism is a philosophical view according to which all events are predetermined by natural law and causality and technological determinism like Karl Marx said: "The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist."

    <h3>
    guiding questions
    </h3>
    <p>
    1. Do our projects moralise implicitly or explicitly? How? The moral is to focus again on details and few things, rather than always wanting more, more next love and respect. You should enjoy your time and the moment more in order to understand things better.
    </p>
    <p>
    2. What values are we inscribing or we want to inscribe in the design? What are the value conflicts that emerge? Optimism, Self-reliance, Minimalism, Relaxation & Influence
    </p>
    <p>
    3. How are these values materialised into a design? Slow products that stimulate or force the user to slow down dentifying ethically relevant issues
    </p>
    <p>
    4. Does something feel not OK? What is it? Why does is feel not OK? Maybe it is too slow and the sometimes low success rate, for example when external conditions don't fit, might make you stop.
    </p>
    <p>
    5. Could this design damage or harm someone or a group or something worth protecting? In what way? Under which circumstances? I don't think that low tech products could harm, as they tend to be relaxing. But there could be frustration if it cannot be used.
    </p>
    <p>
    6. Can it be unevenly beneficial to some and harmful to other? In what way? Under which circumstances? It might be easier for people with a garden and a lot of space than people who live in a flat without a balcony.

    Technologies are multicable. They have developed light bulbs that use less energy and are more sustainable but now we light them non-stop and light up buildings because "we can", it costs little energy and in the end uses just as much energy.It is also called Jerevon's Pradox (according to which technical progress that allows the more efficient use of a raw material ultimately leads to an increase in the use of that raw material instead of a decrease). Herbert Simon 1996 said: “Design is concerned with how things ought to be”. Products, which influence human action or socially responsible behaviour, design seeks to influence behaviour in a particular way. For example the flight in the pissoir, which helps people being concentrated peeing on the animal which creates less dirt. Then there are four other ways to design: decisive, coercive (anti-theft devices, metro with the entrance gate, where you need a ticket to enter, anti-sleep areas for homeless people), persuasive (you get informations, for example how much energy was produced to make the product or how many bikes you could place instead of one car) or seductive (in a playful way).

    Ethics are an activity it’s not a thing. There are guiding questions like:  What is the right thing to do? What actions are morally justifiable? What is good? What kind of person I want to be? But nothing is black and white. You have different types of ethics:
    </p>
    <p>
    •	Deontology (Ethics of principles), which could be in a religious way (bible) or a non religious way (Emanual Kant), which is about lying, steeling, killing, manipulating  and so on. Ethics of principles are difficult to apply, because we don’t know what is right and wrong and also too rationalist, because they just go with the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
    •	Consequentioalism (Ethics of effects), but its difficult to apply (how do you calculate that?) And also it can be used to justify justifies. It could also be experiments between life and death, like the trolley experiment.
    </p>
    <img class="left" src="trolley.png" alt="Naturbild" width="30%" height="auto"/>
    <p>
    •	Care ethicsm like Feminism, rasism, sexism. “Care seems to me to be the most basic of moral values. Without care as an empirically describable practice, we cannot have life at all since human beings cannot survive without it. Without some level of caring concern for other human beings, we cannot have any morality. These requirements are not just empirical givens. In every context of care, moral evaluations are needed. Then, without some level of caring moral concern for all other human beings, we cannot have a satisfactory moral theory” (Virginia Held)

    guiding questions 2
    </h3>
    <p>
    1. Imagine your solution was analog and not digital. How would the experience be?
    </p>
    <p>
    2. Could your solution beapart of an episode in Black Mirror (a dysto-pian science fictionseries)? Try to imagine the plot
    </p>
    <p>
    3.	Does your solution create increased inequality? Why / why not?
    </p>

    submission: effects
    </h3>
    <p>
    1.  positive: go out of the comfort zone, using your spare time different
    </p>
    <p>
    2.  negative: not interesting enough, nothing completely new
    </p>
    <p>
    3.	Foreesable: too slow, people want to make everything fast more efficient, because they don´t have time (work, childrens, ...)
    </p>
    <p>
    other effects: Direct and indirect, Unequal effects for different actors, Effects on relationships between actors or Effects on different levels: individual

    the goods of design

    This class was about an iquiry into design professional ethics. Not everyone is a designer, but there are people who can engage in the practice of design. In design as a professional practice there can be different types like darc patterns. There is a lot of corruption also in Europe in big companies and also hospitals, but sometimes people lye because they don´t know it and make it by mistake. You can also have different kind of codes of ethics: Safety and legal standard have to be ruled in design but the rest you can follow but you don’t need to, ethics are more than compliances. We don’t have this checklist to design that’s why design could also destroy because it could get into the market quiet fast and nobody can control or change it anymore. “We act rightly ‘when the time comes’ not out of strength of will but out of the quality of our usual attachments and with the kind of energy and discernment which we have available.” Iris Murdoch. Also there was a famous kitchen debate on an American exhibition 1959 in Moscow about the pros and cons of the capitalism and communism from Richard Nixon und Nikita Chruschtschow. The goods of design you can get through practises, which can be internal and external. External goods are crucial and internal good: you can only obtain through designing.
