    <p>
    Technology is a part of our existence, it is not neutral, not does it determine us. We cannot be human without technology anymore, its almost impossible to avoid, like we are living in the Technosphere. Also during designing things we use technology in different ways, for example we use trees to protect the streets or design for example toothbrushes because in our society we said teeth hygiene is important. Technologies not has to be high tech, also other artifacts and processes are included in technology. Neutrality (To have no impact in the world) is in the middle of soft determinism (using technologies, but know they are affecting) and hard determinism (make us be how we are). Determinism is a philosophical view according to which all events are predetermined by natural law and causality and technological determinism like Karl Marx said: "The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist."

    <h3>
    questions
    </h3>
    <p>
    1. Do our projects moralise implicitly or explicitly? How?
    </p>
    <p>
    2. What values are we inscribing or we want to inscribe in the
    design? What are the value conflicts that emerge?
    </p>
    <p>
    3. How are these values materialised into a design?
    </p>
    <p>
    4. Does something feel not OK? What is it? Why does is feel not OK?
    </p>
    <p>
    5. Could this design damage or harm someone or a group or something worth protecting? In what way? Under which circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
    6. Can it be unevenly beneficial to some and harmful to other? In what way? Under which circumstances?

    1. Imagine your solution was analog and not digital. How would the experience be?
    </p>
    <p>
    2. Could your solution beapart of an episode in Black Mirror (a dysto-pian science fictionseries)? Try to imagine the plot
