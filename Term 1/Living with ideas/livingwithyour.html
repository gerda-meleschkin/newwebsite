      make a magic machine

    <p>
      The first day we got the task from Kristina Andersen (Industrial Design teacher, TU/e in Eindhoven) to search for different kind of materials. Then we had a few seconds to draw ourselves on a white piece of paper and fold the paper a few times. After that we should build something out of the materials we found for the person we just draw.

      My machine/prototype shows the journey through my master. It shows a box with different types of materials (sand, grassland, leaves, snow, water, soil, nutshell, stone). Now I feel a bid confused, like stepping in the darkness trying to find my way through the master and hopefully find the right trail. The different materials symbolise the different steps in my journey, where everyone is important. Also it shows you can find the right way buy connecting to the nature.  And in the end you find the lightning/ the way out of being confused in the labyrinth. But there is not only one way to go!

      The interventions in the group revolve around various discourses one makes, in search for identity of oneself. There is a shared common interest in finding a balance between the internal and the external parts of life. This balance is explored by different ways of engagement tied together by a common aspect of positionality.
