    my journey so far
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first term comes with ups and downs. At the beginning of the master I tried to find out which topic interests me the most. I started with a blank sheet of paper, I started from 0, I didn’t had any specific areas of interest I wanted to focus on and was open to everything what was coming. Also I didn't have any expectations or thinking about projects and assignments. It was a journey through my personal development and my professional one. All the different tutors and topics helped me to think about what I want and which direction I would like to focus on. Also doing each week a reflection was super helpful to mirror the week´s input and output and let me know if I want to know more about a specific topic. I had three main learning of the first semester. One of them was idea generation, because of having new and challenging projects in different kind of topics. The second one is reflect and think about more what I like and want. And the third one is to not focus to much, explore more and try things out.
    </p>
    <p>
    I would like to focus now on two different topics, one is agriculture and the other one is human behaviour. Both of this topics are interesting a lot. Among other reasons the agriculture/bio class helped to figured out that there a many different kind of issues in the agriculture field, for example you have a lot of trash, which is unused and get burned and also soil problems. There are many parts, which could be better, more efficient and sustainable. And also human behaviour is interesting me a lot. We live in our own bubble and forget in everyday life what is happening around us, which keeps us back from reality. We don‘t understand ourselves what we want, like and can do and also not the needs of our fellow men. We also forget the importance of nature and animals for our well-being and life on this planet. I have the feeling that through more holistic thinking and connection to na¬ture we can again better understand the connections and thus for more sustainability. I think that in our own bubble we often don‘t understand our own impact on this planet. Also for me its interesting to the digital dependence and the raising rate of people having mental issues like depressions, burnout and anxieties. We live in a fast paced society and don't have the time to give it much thought, so we'd rather move on to the next thing.

    I thought about my role as a designer. When I first studied industrial product design I just thought about different kind of physical products, like kitchen tools, furniture or machines. And then I reflect that in this world full of different products you already have “enough”. Now I see my role as a designer different. Everything is connected with design, are these books, apps, furniture, labels, tools or pencils. I think design could be also a tool to bring people together, address them, also to communicate ideas or bring transparency to difficult topics, where for example also ui/ux design plays a big role. Design creates trust and let people get affected or are not interested in using/buying. With my skills on being a maker, empathetic and interested in psychology and my way of designing I want to be part of something and accompany or support good projects.

    My goal for this master is to make a science master thesis about my topic. I don´t want to focus on doing a product, but first on a theoretical/conceptional thesis. My next steps would be to focus more on my topic, after I decided want I would like to do. I would like to try to think about solutions and first ideas. Also I would like to improve research and storytelling, because both things are not easy for me and I think both of them are important to communicate ideas and thoughts and make a relevant science paper. My objectives for that would be doing research with books and articles, get some inspiring conversations with experts and think about useful intervention regarding my topic.

    <h3>
    ideas design intervention
    </h3>
    <p>
    Bubble thinking: People are getting egoistic, disconnected to nature, don’t understand the interrelationships and the importance of nature. My intervention idea: make art in nature, recognizing and assigning tree species, nature meditation (drinking cacao), nature sounds, a journey through the forest, feel different materials (leaves, wind, water, branches), smell pine scent
    </p>
    <p>
    Mentall illness: People getting more often a burnout through stress at work or depressions, also childrens through cybermobbing. My intervention idea: Are you satisfied with your current life? Are you doing what you always wanted to do? Showing people that they are not alone and its important to talk about it and reflect yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
    Addiction to short term pleasures: People have a dopamine overflow, you need more and more to be happy. And the invernetion: talk about tools for a digital detox, about who does what to get away from social media, how much time do you spend on social media?, Do you like yourself the way you are?, Show how much energy and water is consumed  and Show how much it causes in your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
    Desertification: Monoculture makes the soil dead, its better to plant permaculture and learn how to regenerate and safe the good soil. Intervention about: planting things, what to buy, what which season, prevent and combat diseases/parasites, which soil and inform about the importance of soil and regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Living-self sufficient: energy supply is mostly associated with high carbon dioxide emissions and drinking water, as well as the water for sanitation and kitchen needs a lot of energy to reach the individual person. This intervention could show how to live self sufficient and how much it would move.
    </p>
    <p>
    Illegal activities: Like fishing, hunting, killing of extinct animals, deforestation, bad working conditions are getting more and more normal. Intervention to show the possibilities of blockchain and how important it is to check where your products comes from and buy more regional.
