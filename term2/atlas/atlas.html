    <p>
    The first class was about the anthropocene we are inn. There are many upcoming problems in the world which are caused by the climate change. Also the raising amount of co2 in the air is changing the whole ecosystems called earth. When there is the growing season of the plants there is the most of the co2 in the air, because there is more photosynthesis. The big five of things poluting the most co2 in the air are energy, industry, transportation, construction and then agriculture. For capturing the amounts of co2 there are different methods, but its not always the good compared to costs, scalability, permanence and cleanness.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example the method “Co2 utilisation” is to reuse co2 as economically valuable product. CO2 is either transformed using chemical reactions into materials, chemicals and fuels, or it is used directly in processes such as enhanced oil recovery. There are different ways of co2 storage: open which are is vegetation or soil, closed which is the seatwater or litospheere and cycling is for example in the transportation. Most of that utilisation is associated with medium- or long- term storage in open and closed pathways. Possible problems include not just direct CO2 emissions, but also other greenhouse gas emissions, direct and indirect land-use change; and emissions from other parts of the process. In order to make an appreciable difference to the global flows of CO2, pathways need to have the potential to scale quickly. Overall, CO2 utilisation has the potential to operate at large scale and at low cost, meaning it could be big business in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is also a method which called carbon capture and storage (CCS), where limit Co2 emissions in the atmoshphere. This shows "open" use pathways (purple arrows) that store CO2 in leaky natural systems such as forests, which can go from a sink to a source very quickly. "Closed" pathways (red), such as building materials, provide nearly permanent storage of CO2. Finally, "cyclic" uses (yellow), such as CO2-based fuels, where carbon is redeployed over short periods of time.

    <p>
    Carbon storing habitats include: forests, salt marshes, seagrass beds, cold-water coral reefs, flame shell, muscle beds and mael (which is a type of sand). Trees and plants are capturing a big amount of Co2, but they also need a lot of water and long period of time to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also the climate change brings different problems like ice melting, which lets a big amount of Co2 in the air, because the glaciers include Co2. In 2019 many glaciers melted and let a big amount of pollution free. Also the diversity of animals is shrinking, for example in 2018 we have seen the last mal rhinoceros. At this point we know the most important ressources are drinking water and sand. And we know because of this importance the amount is increasing every day and could cause “wars” in the future.
