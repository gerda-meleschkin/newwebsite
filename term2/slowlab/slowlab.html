    Each plant need various nutrients also they have different kind of deficiency symptoms. Normally plants get it directly from the soil in the nature, which should include all natural nutrients, but because of the use of the big amount of pesticides the soil is dying and looses these important nutrients. Also because the hydroponic system doesn’t consist soil, the nutrients need to be added extra. Hydroponicsystem are really good to save water and space and are very useful when you don’t have a garden and want to grow your own vegetables. So its important to add the right amount and the specific nutrients for the hydroponic plants.

    There are different ways to get nutrients, if you have bokashi compost or any other compost which creates a big amount of liquid its possible to use that and mix it with water or you buy chemical one which include all the relevant macro and micro nutrients.

    There are different kind of types of nutrients solutions the hoagland solution, the working solution and the steiner solution. Like we humans also plants need micro and makro nutrients. The macro nutrients include proteins and bring energy and micro nutrients include specific ingredients.
