    remixing materials
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first part of this course we were exploring different kind of materials and their functions. The first task was to chose a material and analyse it. Audrey, Paula and me analysed a tow material parts, which were out off avocado seed mixed with iron oxide and the other one out of hierba mate with pine resin. Both came from Latin America and could be manipulated while drilling and assembling. You have different options to fabricate:  planters, roofs, walls, flours, furniture like tables, plates, jewellery and so on.
