    remixing materials
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first part of this course we were exploring different kind of materials and their functions. The first task was to chose a material and analyse it. Audrey, Paula and me analysed a tow material parts, which were out off avocado seed mixed with iron oxide and the other one out of hierba mate with pine resin. Both came from Latin America and could be manipulated while drilling and assembling. You have different options to fabricate:  planters, roofs, walls, flours, furniture like tables, plates, jewellery and so on.

    Audrey, Paula B. and me were creating the second class the four different materials. Material 1 is with Agargar, Material 2 is with Alginate and Material 3 is with resin and Wax.  But first we needed to prepare the food waste. We should collect all our food waste, like peels, coffeeground or egg shells. Then we needed to dry everything till its completely dried out and then grind into very small pieces. For making biomaterials its important that everything is completely dry otherwise it could starts to get bacteria’s and mould. You have five different ingredients: Plasticizer (to make it flexible and make it less easy to break, Pigments to add colors, additives like food  waste/flowers/leaves etc, biopolymer like gluten, agaragar or alginate and water. When doing biomaterials the steps are important. After preparing the additives, its important to weight them, prepare jares/fabric (with glass and plastic vessels it shrinks on the sides, with wood it sticks on the sides and shrinks vertically) etc, mix ingredients (it is important to measure everything precise and take notes), cook or mix it cool (depends on the recipe), add plasticiser and mix, then add the pigments and additives (if you add something liquid, substract it of  the amount of water) and mix and pour it into the mold, let it dry a few days and then take it out.

    Materialbasic 1:For the first biomaterial we needed 10 gram of agar-agar (quimics dalmau), 200 ml water, 2ml vinegar and 2ml glycerine. Our group prepared different food waste for the biomaterials, unfortunately they weren´t dry enough so we couldn’t use any to avoid the moulding. So we used the materials we got. For the first vessel we added curcuma and orange peels. The second one got egg-shells and the third one we mixed hierva mate with spirulina as a pigment. First we mixed agar-agar with water and start cooking it until its boiling. Then we lower the head and added vinegar and glycerin and stir it until it is a homogeneous liquid. Then we added ouf food-waste and pigments. We realised that to make biomaterials its easier to make it completely transparent while using galantine instead of agar-agar. When using agar-agar we recognized it got fast milky. Also from the material with the egg-shells we got the best result, it got fast hard and the right consistency and quality. The first material with the orange peels didn’t dry good.

    Materialbasic 2:For the second material we need to prepare two mixtures. One for the basic material and one for calcium chloride liquid. For the liquid we just miyed 250 ml of water with 15 gramm of calcium chloride. First we prepared our fabrics and additives. Then we start mixing, but not boiling this time, 12,5 gram alginate with 500ml water. After the mixture gets homogeneous we added 30ml glycerin and the some blue mica pigments. After that we separated the mixture in half. For the first half we sprayed first some calcium liquid on the fabric, then distribute the mixture on the  fabric and spread some egg, garlic and onion shells, but this time didn’t mixed it. And also dripped some gold mica powder as a pigment. Then we sprayed again the calcium liquid on the material and let it dry. For the second half we put the mixture in a large injection and extrude it into the calcium chloride liquid. The we took it out and it looks like spaghetti, which was amazing (you can see it in the middle picture on the top.

    Materialbasic 3:For this biomaterial we needed 45 gram of pine resin, 15ml alcohol (90%), 5 gram carnauba way and 40-60 gram of food waste. Our group used four different ingredients for the food waste. For the first we added crushed egg shells and onion skins. For the second one we added coffee grounds. The third one we mixed with hierva mate and the last one with orange and lemon peels. To all of them we also added pigments like mika and spirulina to give them stronger colours. We could see a difference between the different food waste types. The one with the egg shells got really hard and dried fast and the one with the coffee ground the opposite. It never got completely hard and is still sticky, because we added to much coffee ground. In general we could see that when adding more food waste which has already a hard and strong texture is better for this method. So in the end you can drill and mill the material into different shapes.
