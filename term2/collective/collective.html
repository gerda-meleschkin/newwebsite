    Internet is defined by protocols not platforms, which are all connected with each other, where the protocols can be centralised, desentralised or distributed. Also there are more users using internet for facebook than for other pages. The platforms (Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagramm,…) are so big so we forget that this happens in the internet. There is not just one sight to communicate, they all together. But for example the gemini protocol refers to the totality of information provided via the Gemini protocol. The Gemini protocol is a network protocol for retrieving documents over the Internet that emphasizes simplicity and text-oriented content. In this way Gemini is similar to Gopher, but is based on encrypted connections to protect user privacy.

    Sometimes its hard to find a way of designing something and avoiding to get copied, because you are not the owner when you are a designer, people are allowed to see it. But there are many processes going on to chase copyrights. NFT´s for example have a clear copyright through the blockchain. Its not possible to copy them, each of them can just have one official owner, which is registered. But it’s important to understand that the computer has the data base and a computer never held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management of decision.

    Basically the internet is working with optical fiver cables. There could be an antenna close by which gives the signals to a satellite and this satellite brings the signals to an antenna close to your phone and then to your phone.  But it take to much time. So now the internet is working through these optical fiver cables which connect between data server and your device. Your device could be connected through the WI-fi router or via cellular data antenna´s and through this two ways with the cables. There are huge servers could be in the US or other countries, who are storing your data, which is a solid state device (SSD) within the data center. The SSD is the internal memory of a server. And the server is a powerful computer. So every google server has a different function.

    Internet is a big amount of computer networks connected with each other. And the World wide web = www is to connect all this servers, computers which each other, makes it easier to share information using these interconnected computers. There are always errors and request and a back and forward connection. VPN for example opens the internet structures like a tunnel and makes it accessible for people in other countries. Then you have google analytics which gets all our data (which includes out favourite pages, characteristics, interests etc.) and show us specific  advertisement.
