    the distributive nature of design - "thomas diez"

    Economic growth was influenced by various processes. At the beginning, significant changes occurred due to technological revolution and industrialization. Convenience and imprudent buying also contribute to capitalism. Because when we consciously decide to buy, wear or use something, we unconsciously support the production or company. But economic growth cannot be infinite, because the scarcity of raw materials is a reality, as well as cheap labor and illegal trade. It is important to understand that we can influence many things with design and that we should understand it and not exploit it. Design should help to involve the user in the life cycle through distributed design for example. Distributed design doesn't have to happen only in big companies, it can also happen in neighborhoods or makerspaces like the "Fadlab". It is said to be opensource and accessible to all. Initiatives to support traditional business development systems and communities are supported, as well as models that allow relationships to develop between different people. For example, through digital fabrication with artisanal and instrumental production processes, competence development and resilience can be continued.

    •	“Our existence happens thanks to a series of design decisions at a personal and collective level on a larger scale.”

    •	“Every design decision generates economic, social, ecological, and even geological changes on a planetary scale”.
    </p>

    •	“Distributed Design allows us to bring the principles of digital revolutions in communications and computing to the production and consumption of products.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“Distributing design means designing a democratic and conscious tool to empower innovators, creators, citizens, and people with ideas to make their individual and collective dreams come true.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	„Design is the most powerful tool we have as a human species, and it must be accessible to all.”

    steps to an ecology of mind - "gregory bateson"
    </h3>

    <p>
    This book is about bridging the facts of life and behavior in combination with what we know about the nature of patterns and order. Many try to build a bridge between behavioral and physical and chemical sciences, even though behavior cannot be described in terms of mass and length (physical forces). Common adjectives in behavioral science are: ego, fear, instinct, intention, mind, self, intelligence, stupidity, and maturity, but these are very different.  Science had no conscious goal for his knowledge. It works by two essential aspects: the observations cannot be denied and the bases must fit. Data is a reliable source of information for scientists, such as that of the scientist Shannon, who established information theory, which deals with concepts such as information and entropy, information transmission, data compression and coding, and related topics. How did ideas come together? Was there a natural selection of which ideas die out? According to the origin myth of the Judeo-Christian peoples, that God created the sky and then light on the dry planet, he called the light day and the darkness night and after the darkness came the first day, then water gathered in the sky and God called the planet earth and the water around sea. Problems of modern science were already hinted at in the first verses of the thundering prose: The problem of the origin and nature of matter is summarily dismissed / The passage deals at length with the problem of the origin of order / A separation is thus generated between the two sorts of problem. / Order is seen as a matter of sorting and dividing. / Closely linked with the sorting and dividing is the mystery of classification, to be followed later by the extraordinary human achievement of naming. / In conclusion, the question whether the basic loading of science and philosophy was gained by inductive reasoning from empirical data is not simple!

    •	“I have said vaguely that any study which throws light upon the nature of "order" or "pattern" in the universe is surely nontrivial.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“By use of this diagram, it became clear that a difference between my habits of thought and those of my students sprang from the fact that they were trained to think and argue inductively from data to hypotheses but never to test hypotheses against knowledge derived by deduction from the fundamentals of science or philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“Always there is a transformation or recoding of the raw event which intervenes between the scientist and his object.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“…energy expended in behavior must surely be included in this budget; therefore it seemed sensible to think of energy as a determinant of behavior.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“But mental process, ideas, communication, organization, differentiation, pattern, and so on, are matters of form rather than substance.”

    design as participation - "kevin slavin"

    <p>
    It's about understanding the designer not as the center of the system but as a participant and designing entire systems in combination with other forces, ideas and events. Mies, an architect who says that everything is perfect until man uses it and designs and changes it himself, so he designed his products so that you can't change and mess up much. The first official user might be Don Norman at Apple, who brought the term "User Centered Design - UCD" to life, which means the interface between physical interaction and design. Here the word user includes drivers, passengers, authors, customers, readers and so on. "User centered design" is concerned with addressing a user's wants, needs and inaccessibilities and adapting the design to them (which don norman invented and is still of great importance today). Through the erkenntise about wishes and the behavior of the users, some things became really famous. But if we focus too much on the users, we forget the needs of the actors of other systems. Like buying online at "Amazon" or food services like "Uber-eats" or "Getier" we don't get anything from the work, logistics or the cook and so on. Big companies build these complicated systems which they then have to hide so that the concentration is on the user. Fun palace from price was more like a system with an unstable behavior, which is unpredictable and indeterminate. His architecture was more than a contemporary of cybernetics and he did not design for the user (ucd) but for all uses he did not know. Another example is a building made of hi-fi materials that is virtually made of earth and can be composted again, with almost no waste, energy consumption and carbon emissions, which means that it participates in the built environment, as well as the environment, the gardens, the production, agriculture, etc..

    •	“If a user spends more time with something, it’s better than something they spend less time with.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“When the methodologies of design and science infect one another, however, design is not just a framework for participants, but something that is also, itself, participating.”
    </p>
    <p>
    •	“In other words, it’s not as simple as making sure that people are participating with the building rather, the building is explicitly designed to participate in the built environment around it, as well as the natural environment beyond it, …”
