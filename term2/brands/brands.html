    <h3>
    our purpose as a designer
    </h3>
    <p>
    First we should think about again why we are designer for emergent futures: I think everything is connected with design (products, graphics, books, music, movies, furniture, clothes and so on. And itâ€™s a tool to communicate and create the industry 4.0, where I want to participate and not wait. The next task was to think about our purpose, which is stable through our beliefs and experiences.  My purpose is satisfaction, justice and equality, because I think it helps against mental illness, a bigger collaboration between people and the nature and could prevent wars. I belief in the good in people and also in the fact if you really want something you can get it.
